# Heatmap of TV show ratings - [tv-ratings.live](https://tv-ratings.live)

One weekend, I was discussing with my friends bout how certain popular TV shows became better over time and others worsened. I told them that I'd only start watching a show if it's ratings suggest that the show gets better over seasons. 

But apart from word of mouth, I did not find a way to actually visualize how shows fared over time. 

So I decided to do it myself. This is the result.
